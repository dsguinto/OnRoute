### Feature 1 submission

#### Nai-Hsien: accommodations.php and models/Hotel.php

- Still working on search functionality for hotels by city name
- Database.php connection string changed to localhost. Didn't push to github to avoid merging conflict.

#### Will Midgette: flightNumberSearch.php and flightInfo.php

- Feature allows a user to enter their flight number to check the details of their flight
- Validation on flightNumberSearch.php tells user if they have not entered a flight number, or if the database could not find a flight from the flight number they entered
- If the database can find a flight with the entered flight number, it stores it as a session variable and redirects the user to the flightInfo.php page

#### Alexis Arevalo: vehicles.php and vehicleSelection.php

- Displaying all the available vehicles in the database, and the user can select a vehicle by clicking on it.
- When the user selects a vehicle, they are redirected to (vehicleSlection.php) a vehicle information page which is retrieved by the stored vehicle 'id'.
- All inputs made to vehicle search form are validated against empty fields. - Working on Sanitizing input fields against malicious code injections.
- User is able to search the database for vehicles based off of pick-up locations, pick-up dates, and return dates.

#### Daniel Guinto: index.php, flights.php, flightBooking.php and models/Flights.php

- Main search feature that allows users to search the flights table based off of airports, dates, airlines, etc.
- Validation checks if user left field empty, or if search input does not have any results
- Successful results will display a table with all the values matching the search result
- Flights that have passed will display a "Book Unavailable" notice
- Flights that are in the future will display a "Book" button. If the user clicks the button, the data from the flight they selected will be saved and they will be carried over to the flightBooking.php page. Their selected flight will appear on this page, and they will be prompted review their flight details before confirming. Once they click the button, a flightBooking row will be added to the flightBooking table in the dB. Meals and seat selections will be able to be added later.

-Login for the users mostly finished
-User model will handle all the user related data
-Working on integrating the login with the flight details in the flightOptions.php page alongside Will
-Next steps: Integrate the user feature with all the other features and make a registration feature
-Implement phpmailer into the services page and to a forgot password page
