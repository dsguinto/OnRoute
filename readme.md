A small team was put together for our PHP Web Application course, where we were required to create a database driven, dynamic and responsive website with PHP as our backend language.

As such, my team came up with "OnRoute", a travel website that allows users to create an account, allowing them to search and book flights, accommodations, and vehicle rentals. The data of the website is stored in a phpMyAdmin database and is grabbed through SQL queries. The page is dynamic, changing according to the user, what bookings they have made, and what bookings are made available on the database. Our current state of the website focuses on the user/client side, and does not incorporate an administrative side. There are also some features that are a still a work in progress!

The main interface design of the website was handled by myself, creating the shared header & footer, fonts and main color scheme. The pages I was responsible for include

- /index.php
- /flights.php
- /flightBooking.php
- /deleteFlightBooking.php
- /deleteVehicleRental.php
- /myAccount.php

### NOTE: Changes were made for github repo (mainly for organization purposes)
